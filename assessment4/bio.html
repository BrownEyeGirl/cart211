                <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>


                <p>After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family 
                    marked by the experiences of war and exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, 
                    and his grandmother, a former rice farmer, profoundly shaped his imagination and
                     relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to learn how to 
                     read and write. </p>
                    
                <p>They studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English 
                    from Brooklyn College, followed by an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.</p>
                
                <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>


                <p>His first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the collection 
                    Night Sky with Exit Wounds (2016) that he gained international recognition. His 
                    poetry explores themes of the Vietnam War’s legacy, migration, queer identity, and 
                    the fragility of language. </p>

                <p>In 2019, he published his debut novel, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, widely 
                    acclaimed by critics. Written as a letter to his illiterate mother, the book 
                    intertwines autobiography, family history, and reflections on sexuality, race, and 
                    inherited trauma. </p>

                <p>In 2022, he released Time Is a Mother, a poetry collection shaped by mourning his
                     mother’s death and an even more intimate exploration of grief and survival.
                    Ocean Vuong currently teaches literature and creative writing at the University 
                    of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
